# Introduction to proofs with Lean

This is an English translation of the exercises from the course “Logique et
démonstrations assistées par ordinateur” at Paris-Saclay university.

It uses Lean and its controlled natural language library 
[Verbose Lean](https://github.com/PatrickMassot/verbose-lean4/).

A lot of text has been machine-translated, so don’t hesitate to point out weird
things.

Also don’t hesitate to reach out if you want to use this for teaching. In
particular, I can give you access to all the solution files.
