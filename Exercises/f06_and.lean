# File 6 : Conjunctions

Given two statements `P` and `Q`, the statement `P` and `Q` (denoted `P ∧ Q`)
is called the *conjunction* of `P` and `Q` :

`P ∧ Q` is true if and only if `P` and `Q` are both true.

## Proving a conjunction

To prove a conjunction `P ∧ Q`, both statements `P` and `Q` must be
proven. To do this, we use the command `Let's first prove that ...` to
announce the first goal and then, once this goal has been proved,
`Let's now prove that ...` (these are the same commands as for proving the two
implications of an equivalence).

Example "Proving a conjunction."
  Given: (a : ℝ)
  Assume: (ha : a > 0)
  Conclusion: a^2 > 0 ∧ |a| > 0
Proof:
  Let's first prove that a^2 > 0
  Since a > 0 we conclude that a^2 > 0
  Let's now prove that |a| > 0
  Since a > 0 we get that a ≠ 0
  Since a ≠ 0 we conclude that |a| > 0

Exercise "06.1 Proving a conjunction."
  Given: (a : ℝ)
  Assume: (ha : a > 0)
  Conclusion: 2*a > 0 ∧ (a^2)^2 > 0
Proof:

QED

/-
The course also has a small database of statements that include implications
whose hypothesis is a conjunction, leading to the need to prove conjunctions.
These statements can be used without justification using the command
`It suffices to prove that ...`
as usual with implicit implications.

An example of such a statement is `∀ x y, (-y ≤ x ∧ x ≤ y) ⇒ |x| ≤ y`.

Example "Proving a statement following from a conjunction."
  Given: (a b : ℝ)
  Assume: (h : a - b ≥ -1) (h' : a - b ≤ 1)
  Conclusion: |a - b| ≤ 1
Proof:
  It suffices to prove that -1 ≤ a - b and a - b ≤ 1
  Let's first prove that -1 ≤ a - b
  We conclude by hypothesis
  Let's now prove that a - b ≤ 1
  We conclude by hypothesis

## Using a conjunction

To use that a conjunction `P ∧ Q` is true we use that the statements `P` and
`Q` are both true.

To do this, we use the command
`Since P ∧ Q we get that P and Q`
where `hP` and `hQ` are any of the available names.

Example "Using a conjunction"
  Given: (a : ℝ)
  Assume: (h : 0 ≤ a ∧ a ≤ 1)
  Conclusion: a ≤ 2
Proof:
  Since 0 ≤ a ∧ a ≤ 1 we get that 0 ≤ a and a ≤ 1
  Since a ≤ 1 we conclude that a ≤ 2

In the example above, the `ha` assumption is never used, so we can omit it.

Example "Using part of a conjunction"
  Given: (a : ℝ)
  Assume: (h : 0 ≤ a ∧ a ≤ 1)
  Conclusion: a ≤ 2
Proof:
  Since 0 ≤ a ∧ a ≤ 1 we get that a ≤ 1
  Since a ≤ 1 we conclude that a ≤ 2
QED

/-
Furthermore, the `Since` command takes the initiative of splitting the
conjunctions appearing to hypothèse when looking for justifications of
statements appearing between `Since` and `we conclude that` or `we get` or
`it suffices to prove that`. We can therefore be satisfied with the second line
in the above proof.

The course also has a small database of implications with a conjunction as the
conclusion. These statements can be used without justification.

An example of such a statement is `∀ x y, |x| ≤ y ⇒ (-y ≤ x ∧ x ≤ y)`.

Example "Using a statement implying a conjunction"
  Given: (a b : ℝ)
  Assume: (ha : |a| ≤ 1)
  Conclusion: a ≤ 2
Proof:
  Since |a| ≤ 1 and |a| ≤ 1 ⇒ -1 ≤ a ∧ a ≤ 1 we get that -1 ≤ a and a ≤ 1
  Since a ≤ 1 we conclude that a ≤ 2

In fact, you can even leave the implication implicit.

Example "Using a statement implying a conjunction,
         without mentioning the implication."
  Given: (a b : ℝ)
  Assume: (ha : |a| ≤ 1)
  Conclusion: a ≤ 2
Proof:
  Since |a| ≤ 1 we get that -1 ≤ a and a ≤ 1
  Since a ≤ 1 we conclude that a ≤ 2

Another statement of the same type, which will be used very frequently in the
following files, is
`∀ x a b, x ≥ max a b ⇒ (x ≥ a ∧ x ≥ b)`.

The next exercise requires more thought. It involves the notion of gcd of two
natural numbers and divisibility. Remember that the divisibility bar is not the
bar above the Enter on a qwerty keyboard, but a unicode symbol that can be
obtained by `,dvd`.

The `We compute` command (and its cousin the `by computation` justification in
`Calc`) know that
`∀ a b, gcd a b ∣ a`
and
`∀ a b, gcd a b ∣ b`
and also
`∀ a, a ∣ a`.

The lemma database contains the statement
`∀ a b : ℕ, (a ∣ b ∧ b ∣ a) ⇒ a = b`
(note that this statement is false for integers and, for this reason,
the following exercise would not work with relative integers).

It also contains the statement
`∀ a b c : ℕ, (c ∣ a ∧ c ∣ b) ⇒ c ∣ gcd a b`

These five statements are enough to do the exercise.

The following exercise also requires a fair amount of thought.

We can use the disjunction lemma asserting that the order relation on the reals
is total:
`∀ x y, x ≤ y ∨ y ≤ x`

and the anti-symmetry lemma for this order relation:
`∀ x y, (x ≤ y ∧ y ≤ x) ⇒ x = y`
